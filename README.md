# Yato

A CLI application to stream anime with [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) integration and Discord Rich Presence, written in Rust.

*The application is named after the protagonist of Noragami: [Yato](https://noragami.fandom.com/wiki/Yato)*

## Features
- Stream anime online
- Update anime in Anilist after completion
- Skip anime __intros__, __outros__ and __recaps__
- Skip __filler__ episodes
- Per-anime skip overrides â€” configure global skip settings (e.g. skip all intros), but customize behavior for specific anime by toggling them individually
- Discord presence
- Local anime history to continue from where you left off last time
- Configurable through config file

## ðŸ“¸ Showcase

## Installing and Setup
> **Note**: Yato requires [MPV](https://mpv.io) as the video player (support for others like VLC may be added in the future).

### Linux

```bash
curl -Lo curd https://github.com/Nandor206/yato/releases/latest/download/yato

chmod +x yato
sudo mv yato /usr/bin/
yato
```
> ##### Tested only on Fedora 42.
> If you're using macOS and can compile Yato, I'd appreciate it if you could share the binary â€” it would help others install it more easily too!
